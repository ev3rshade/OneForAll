## Inspiration

Being raised in Vietnam, one of our members have witnessed multiple cases of generational trauma as the result of the continuous war in my country in the past. Hence, it is not uncommon to spot an abusive household that inflicts physical or psychological trauma on the child. Having noticed this, this team worked together to focus this project on the idea of providing support for women who have been taken advantage of and are in need of immediate help.

## What it does

The web app is capable of providing geoconnections for the ones who are in need of shelters, food, pastries, and so on. It also provides helpful resources, including emergency hotlines and a chatbot to converse and generates advice for the users.

## How we built it

The project was mainly created with Python and Flask for the back-end, and CSS, JavaScript, HTML, and React for the front-end.

## Challenges we ran into

It was not easy to manage the Goroq API to connect with the front-end as well as control the network that we have been working on, yet all worked out well in the end.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Being able to work together and finish the project in time.

## What we learned

How to use APIs to our advantage and how to be careful with the network that we are using in order to make the web app function properly. Furthermore, we also acquired some basic knowledge about Flask, React, and Groq-API and implement them into our code

## What's next for OneForAll

We are planning to expand our geoconnections and markers, making the web app even more accessible to everyone around the globe. In addition, a tightened security also would also help our app deal with unwanted threats and information breaching.
